# Weekend Challenge 1

For your weekend challenge, you will need to create an application that records employee data, including their salary. We also want to add the salaries up so we know how much weâ€™re spending each month. Start with the forms folder in the github repo provided.

## Hard Mode

Create a delete button that removes an employee from the DOM. Note that in hard mode, it need not remove that Employee's salary from the reported total.

## Pro Mode

Once the employee is deleted, also update the total salaries to discount the removed employee's salary. This will require that the logic knows which element was removed. You will need to stretch yourself for this one. I also recommend that you look into jQuery's .data() function to help complete this. Note, you will need to do something both when the employee is added and when they are deleted to make your application 'smart'.
